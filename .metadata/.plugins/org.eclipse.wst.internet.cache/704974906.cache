<!--
  The generatorConfiguration element is the root element for configurations.
-->
<!ELEMENT generatorConfiguration (properties?, classPathEntry*, context+)>
                        
<!--
  The properties element is used to define a standard Java properties file
  that contains placeholders for use in the remainder of the configuration
  file.
-->
<!ELEMENT properties EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST properties
  resource CDATA #IMPLIED
  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
  
<!--
  The context element is used to describe a context for generating files, and the source
  tables.
-->
<!ELEMENT context (property*, plugin*, commentGenerator?, (connectionFactory | jdbcConnection), javaTypeResolver?,
                         javaModelGenerator, sqlMapGenerator?, javaClientGenerator?, table+)>
<!ATTLIST context id ID #REQUIRED
  defaultModelType CDATA #IMPLIED
  targetRuntime CDATA #IMPLIED
  introspectedColumnImpl CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
  The connectionFactory element is used to describe the connection factory used
  for connecting to the database for introspection.  Either connectionFacoty
  or jdbcConnection must be specified, but not both.
-->
<!ELEMENT connectionFactory (property*)>
<!ATTLIST connectionFactory
  type CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
  The jdbcConnection element is used to describe the JDBC connection that the generator
  will use to introspect the database.
-->
<!ELEMENT jdbcConnection (property*)>
<!ATTLIST jdbcConnection 
  driverClass CDATA #REQUIRED
  connectionURL CDATA #REQUIRED
  userId CDATA #IMPLIED
  password CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
  The classPathEntry element is used to add the JDBC driver to the run-time classpath.
  Repeat this element as often as needed to add elements to the classpath.
-->
<!ELEMENT classPathEntry EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST classPathEntry
  location CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
  The property element is used to add custom properties to many of the generator's
  configuration elements.  See each element for example properties.
  Repeat this element as often as needed to add as many properties as necessary
  to the configuration element.
-->
<!ELEMENT property EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST property
  name CDATA #REQUIRED
  value CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
  The plugin element is used to define a plugin.
-->
<!ELEMENT plugin (property*)>
<!ATTLIST plugin
  type CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
  The javaModelGenerator element is used to define properties of the Java Model Generator.
  The Java Model Generator builds primary key classes, record classes, and Query by Example 
  indicator classes.
-->
<!ELEMENT javaModelGenerator (property*)>
<!ATTLIST javaModelGenerator
  targetPackage CDATA #REQUIRED
  targetProject CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
  The javaTypeResolver element is used to define properties of the Java Type Resolver.
  The Java Type Resolver is used to calculate Java types from database column information.
  The default Java Type Resolver attempts to make JDBC DECIMAL and NUMERIC types easier
  to use by substituting Integral types if possible (Long, Integer, Short, etc.)
-->
<!ELEMENT javaTypeResolver (property*)>
<!ATTLIST javaTypeResolver
  type CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
  The sqlMapGenerator element is used to define properties of the SQL Map Generator.
  The SQL Map Generator builds an XML file for each table that conforms to iBATIS'
  SqlMap DTD.
-->
<!ELEMENT sqlMapGenerator (property*)>
<!ATTLIST sqlMapGenerator
  targetPackage CDATA #REQUIRED
  targetProject CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
  The javaClientGenerator element is used to define properties of the Java client Generator.
  The Java Client Generator builds Java interface and implementation classes
  (as required) for each table.
  If this element is missing, then the generator will not build Java Client classes.
-->
<!ELEMENT javaClientGenerator (property*)>
<!ATTLIST javaClientGenerator
  type CDATA #REQUIRED
  targetPackage CDATA #REQUIRED
  targetProject CDATA #REQUIRED
  implementationPackage CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
  The table element is used to specify a database table that will be the source information
  for a set of ge
